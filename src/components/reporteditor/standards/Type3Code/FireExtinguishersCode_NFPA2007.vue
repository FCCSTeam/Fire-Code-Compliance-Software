        7.4.4.3.3 Compressed air shall be permitted to be used from special compressor systems capable of delivering air 
        with a dew point of -60°F (-51°C) or lower. 
        7.4.4.3.4 The special compressor system shall be equipped with an automatic monitoring and alarm system to ensure that the dew point 
        remains at or below -60°F (-51°C) at all times. 
        7.4.4.3.5* Class D and halocarbon fire extinguishers shall be repressurized only with the type of 
        expellant gas referred to on the fire extinguisher label. 

        7.4.5 Recharge Record Keeping. 
        7.4.5.1 Each fire extinguisher shall have a tag or label attached that indicates the month and year recharging was performed, 
        identifies the person performing the service, and identifies the name of the agency performing the work. 
        7.4.5.2 A verification of service (maintenance or recharging) collar in accordance with 7.3.3.2 shall also be attached to the extinguisher. 
        7.4.5.2.1 Liquefied gas, halogenated agent, and carbon dioxide extinguishers that have been recharged without valve removal shall not be 
        required to have a verification of service collar installed following recharge. 
        7.4.5.2.2 Cartridge- and cylinder-operated extinguishers shall not be required to have a verification of service collar installed. (See 7.3.3.2.)

        8.3.1.1 The hydrostatic retest shall be conducted within the calendar year of the specified test interval. 
        8.3.1.2 In no case shall an extinguisher be recharged if it is beyond its specified retest date. 
        (For nonrechargeable fire extinguishers, see 7.3.1.2.1.3.) 

        4.4 Obsolete Fire Extinguishers. 
        The following types of fire extinguishers are considered obsolete and shall be removed from service: 
        (1)      Soda acid 
        (2)      Chemical foam (excluding film-forming agents) 
        (3)      Vaporizing liquid (e.g., carbon tetrachloride) 
        (4)      Cartridge-operated water 
        (5)      Cartridge-operated loaded stream 
        (6)      Copper or brass shell (excluding pump tanks) joined by soft solder or rivets 
        (7)      Carbon dioxide extinguishers with metal horns 
        (8)      Solid charge–type AFFF extinguishers (paper cartridge) 
        (9)      Pressurized water fire extinguishers manufactured prior to 1971 
        (10)      Any extinguisher that needs to be inverted to operate 
        (11)      Any stored pressure extinguisher manufactured prior to 1955 
        (12)      Any extinguishers with 4B, 6B, 8B, 12B, and 16B fire ratings 
        (13)      Stored-pressure water extinguishers with fiberglass shells (pre-1976) 
        4.4.1 Dry chemical stored pressure extinguishers manufactured prior to October 1984 shall be removed from service 
        at the next 6-year maintenance interval or the next hydrotest interval, whichever comes first. 
        4.4.2 Any fire extinguisher that can no longer be serviced in accordance with the manufacturer's maintenance manual is considered obsolete 
        and shall be removed from service. </pre
